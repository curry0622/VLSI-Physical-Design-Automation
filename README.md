# NTHU CS6135 VLSI Physical Design Automation (2022 Fall)

## HW1: P&R Tool

In this homework, you are asked to use **Cadence Innovus** to complete the P&R (Place and Route) flow for a given synthesized standard-cell design. The goal is to acquaint you with Innovus and the P&R flow. Besides, you are encouraged to try to optimize timing, total area of chip, and total wire length without violating any timing or DRC constraints.

## HW2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning

In this homework, you are asked to implement **Fiduccia–Mattheyses Algorithm** to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning.

## HW3: Fixed-outline Slicing Floorplan Design

In this homework, you are asked to adapt and implement an existing algorithm, published in the DAC-86 paper entitled **A New Algorithm for Floorplan Design** by Wong and Liu, for solving the fixed-outline slicing floorplan design problem with a set of hard blocks.
